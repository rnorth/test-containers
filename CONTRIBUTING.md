# Contributing

* Star the project on [Github](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java) and help spread the word :)
* Join our Slack: http://slack.testcontainers.org
* See [ROADMAP](docs/ROADMAP.md) to understand the approach behind the project and what may/may not be in store for the future.
* [Post an issue](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues) if you find any bugs
* Contribute improvements or fixes using a [Pull Request](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/pulls). If you're going to contribute, thank you! Please just be sure to:
	* discuss with the authors on an issue ticket prior to doing anything big
	* follow the style, naming and structure conventions of the rest of the project
	* make commits atomic and easy to merge
	* verify all tests are passing. Build the project with `./gradlew check` to do this
	
	**PS:** Make sure Docker is running locally and you have the lombok plugin installed in your IDE
	
	**N.B.** Gradle's Build Cache is enabled by default, but you can add `--no-build-cache` flag to disable it.
