# Fixing Issues with Discovering A Supported Container Runtime Environment


If you ended up on this page, 
it seems that either Testcontainers was not able to find a supported container runtime in your environment,
or you found this page while searching for information to deal with errors regarding the environment discovery mechanism of Testcontainers.

Testcontainers requires a supported container runtime environment to be present in order to manage and run containers.
Here is a list of supported container runtime environments:

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [Docker Engine on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Testcontainers Cloud](https://www.testcontainers.cloud?utm_medium=direct&utm_source=testcontainers.com&utm_content=docs&utm_term=on-failure)

For more extensive information on supported container runtime environments, as well as known limitations of alternative container runtime environments,
please refer to [this page](https://java.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/) in our documentation.
