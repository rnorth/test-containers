# CockroachDB Module

!!! note
    This module is INCUBATING. While it is ready for use and operational in the current version of Testcontainers, it is possible that it may receive breaking changes in the future. See [our contributing guidelines](/contributing/#incubating-modules) for more information on our incubating modules policy.

See [Database containers](./index.md) for documentation and usage that is common to all relational database container types.

## Adding this module to your project dependencies

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` file:

```groovy tab='Gradle'
testCompile "org.testcontainers:cockroachdb:{{latest_version}}"
```

```xml tab='Maven'
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>
    <artifactId>cockroachdb</artifactId>
    <version>{{latest_version}}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

!!! hint
    Adding this Testcontainers library JAR will not automatically add a database driver JAR to your project. You should ensure that your project also has a suitable database driver as a dependency.
