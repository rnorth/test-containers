# k6 Module

!!! note 
    This module is INCUBATING. 
    While it is ready for use and operational in the current version of Testcontainers, it is possible that it may receive breaking changes in the future. 
    See [our contributing guidelines](/contributing/#incubating-modules) for more information on our incubating modules policy.

[k6](https://k6.io/) is an extensible reliability testing tool built for developer happiness.
Using this module, you can execute k6 test scripts, optionally building a custom `k6` binary with [k6 extensions](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/extensions/).

## Basic script execution

Execute a simple k6 test script, `test.js`, with commandline options and injected script variable.

Create a simple k6 test script to be executed as part of your tests:

<!--codeinclude-->
[Setup the container](../../modules/k6/src/test/java/org/testcontainers/k6/K6ContainerTests.java) inside_block:standard_k6
[Content of `scripts/test.js`](../../modules/k6/src/test/resources/scripts/test.js) inside_block:access_script_vars
<!--/codeinclude-->

## Customizing k6 using extensions

The extensibility of k6 allows for the creation of custom functionality via [extensions](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/extensions/).
Using the extended k6 image enables scripts to reference extension libraries which will dynamically be compiled into the k6 binary.

!!! warning
    Many available extensions as well as the [builder image](https://github.com/szkiba/k6x) are provided by third parties and may not be supported directly by Grafana Labs.

<!--codeinclude-->
[Setup the container](../../modules/k6/src/test/java/org/testcontainers/k6/K6ContainerTests.java) inside_block:extended_k6
[Content of `scripts/extensions.js`](../../modules/k6/src/test/resources/scripts/extensions.js) inside_block:extensions_script
<!--/codeinclude-->

## Adding this module to your project dependencies
